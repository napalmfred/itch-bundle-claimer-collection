# Itch Bundle Claimer
Userscript that automatizes the claim of all games purchased through a bundle on Itch.io

# IMPORTANT
This userscript is not compatible with Greasemonkey as the GM API changed and Tampermonkey still hasn't updated. To fix this incompatibility you need to change all instances of GM functions from GM_* to GM.*

# Instructions
To use this script you need to install a userscript extension on your browser, I only tested it with Edge Chromium as per my needs. Just add the script, enable it and load the bundle's page. It will take care of everything.
